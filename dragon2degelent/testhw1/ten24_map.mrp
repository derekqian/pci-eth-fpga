  Number of occupied Slices:                     6 out of   6,822    1%
  Nummber of MUXCYs used:                        0 out of  13,644    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           15
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            15 out of      15  100%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      15    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           0 out of      15    0%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  54,576    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
