.
WARNING:Place:1109 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGMUX site pair. The clock
   IOB component <W> is placed at site <V11>. The corresponding BUFG component
   <W_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X2Y3>. There is only a select set
   of IOBs that can use the fast path to the Clocker buffer, and they are not
   being used. You may want to analyze why this problem exists and correct it.
   This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was
   applied on COMP.PIN <W.PAD> allowing your design to continue. This constraint
   disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of
   this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing
   results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the
   design.
